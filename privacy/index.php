								<li>Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li>
								<li>Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, and believe the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.</li>

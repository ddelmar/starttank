						<div class="clr"></div>

It is our belief that as the world grows more complicated, people, more than ever, want to be understood as people. Not numbers. Not trends. Not social media touchpoints. They want to associate with companies that understand their dreams and needs. Companies that share their logo2 core beliefs. This is why we work to uncover your Bedrock Truth™ – the thing your customers most value in you, and the thing you most value in yourself.
<br /><br />By uncovering this valued, shared truth we can forge meaningful relationships between you and your customers on a deeply human level.
<br /><br />Companies and brands are not our own anymore. The world gives and takes approval constantly online. Which is why it's imperative to develop ideas so personally meaningful that people want to share those ideas with others to bring meaning to their lives, too.

Some interesting things have happened since the world became digital. Consumers now share in the ownership of your brand. Content has evolved radically, in its creation and sharing. Expressions, not impressions, are the new guiding force.<br /><br />The brands navigating this landscape successfully share some interesting traits. They have a clear purpose. They’re more honest, transparent and genuine. They’re more intriguing, fully engaged and not easily ignored.
<br /><br />They are, quite simply, more human.
<br /><br />At CTP, we believe a brand’s true potential is unleashed by capturing this human spirit. Backed by data-driven insights. Fueled by a powerful communications engine. And expressed by a group that doesn’t just believe in this force. We actually live it.

In 1968, Jay Hill, Alan Holliday, Jack Connors and Steve Cosmopulos founded an agency in Boston based on the principle that creativity could drive business. Forty five years later, we're still operating on that very same premise, albeit with a few more people. Today, there are more than 900 of us who work at Hill Holliday. Together, we are the 13th largest ad agency in the United States. It's very nice to meet you.

Unlike many agencies, we’ve designed ours with no barriers. No barriers between design, digital marketing, brand content, media planning and advertising. No barriers between our agency and our clients, or between our partners and our clients’ partners. No barriers between us and the new ideas in the world, just waiting for us to discover and apply in the marketing of our client’s brands.

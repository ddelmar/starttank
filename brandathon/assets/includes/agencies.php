							<h3>Carissa Wright. Copywriter.</h3>
<p>
My name is Carissa Wright. I am a 2011 graduate of Boston College and a self-proclaimed word nerd. There is something thrilling about being able to take words and transform them to take an audience to a new place. My mind is overrun with creative ideas, and now I just need a place to put them! Charismatic to the core, I'm a definite people person and a team player, but I also do well working on my own. I am looking to work in an environment that will push me to my limits, challenge my inner thesaurus, and let me work collaboratively with other creative minds.

							<h3>Lauren Turner. Digital Copywriter.</h3>
							<p>
							
I don't take myself to seriously, but I am serious about my work and I think it shows. I have a strong attention to detail and I pour a bit of myself into everything I do. Take a look at www.turnerlauren.com.

<br /><br />A professor quoted Bill Bernbach to me my freshman year, "It's not how short you make it; it's how you make it short." It took me a while to realize the meaning behind these words but now I try to always incorporate this idea in my writing style. 

<br /><br />Aside from writing, I'm an avid runner and have recently taken up surfing. I'd like to call myself a music buff but tend to fall behind so feel free to make recommendations. My iTunes library could always use an update.

<h3>Jay Courtney. Creative Director.</h3>
<p>
To put it briefly, Jay is a good writer because he’s a good listener. He’ll listen to you about your brand, your competition, your marketing philosophy, even your daughter’s soccer game. And for more than 25 years Jay has put these well-honed listening and writing skills to work for a plethora of clients, from local institutions like the Boston Red Sox and Eastern Bank to international brands like the Breeders’ Cup. And don’t worry, Jay does actually talk - although he usually lets his awards do that for him.
<br /><br />
Jay has also worked on major brands such as Sam Adams, American Express, New Balance, Visa, Steinway & Sons, MasterCard, Tufts Health Plan and Lahey Clinic.

							<h3>Bob Troutman. Art Director.</h3>	
							<h3>Rodrigo De Lima. Copywriter.</h3>				
							<p>
I try to come up with good ideas and come up with bad ideas until I get there. I guess the main thing I do is I can usually tell the difference.

<br /><br />I've freelanced in Brazil and the US, most recently at DraftFCB in Chicago.
<br /><br />Where I’ve learned things:<br />
VCU Brandcenter, Florida State University, Traveling, NSAC, Innovation Challenge.
<br /><br />Why my mom is proud of me:<br />
I was an AAF Most Promising Minority Student, I’ve had some work make it into CMYK and I’ve won some student Addys. Also, I got to play a superhero on Brazil’s equivalent of SNL (Casseta & Planeta) after I won a competition to create a new Brazilian superhero.
<br /><br />
Mandatory quirky fact(s) to convince you that I'm interesting:
<br />I've played Counterstrike and Enemy Territory at a world class level. On the latter I was ranked 4th worldwide as a sniper at one point. Also, I’ve raced in the 24 Hours of Lemons auto racing series (I led my team in penalizations).

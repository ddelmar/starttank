	<h1>About Start Tank</h1>

	<p>
Start Tank provides your early stage startup a professional co-working space that gives you easy access to key PayPal employees and the benefits of working side by side with many other startups in the same office. We'll get you the advice and expertise you need, access to angel investors and VCs, all while helping you recruit talent and make important business connections. You'll work through important challenges and experience some of the biggest and most profitable growth your company will have seen to this point. At the end of your tenure at Start Tank, Demo Day brings startups and investors together for the next big step. We've invested heavily in helping startups succeed, but we are only able to do that because not long ago, we were once a startup ourselves. Our office is full of entrepreneurs who are committed to helping other entrepreneurs.

	<h2>The Program</h2>
	<p>
Start Tank provides six months of no-cost professional space, infrastructure, coaching, and community to early stage startups (pre-series A funding). The ideal company is looking for 2-5 desks, an environment that encourages collaboration and innovation, and does not compete with PayPal. As an added bonus, Start Tank startups can use PayPal facilities for events. Several current tenants have already piloted their products within our PayPal Boston office, leveraging a closed beta testing group of more than 200 people. Each startup has a designated sponsor that stays with them during their tenure, helping them navigate our company and facilitating connections to make sure that they get the expert advice they need.

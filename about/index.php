	<h1>About Start Tank</h1>

	<p>
Start Tank provides early stage startups with what we call “innovation” space. You get easy access to key PayPal employees and the benefits of working side by side with many other startups in a great office environment. 
<br /><br />
We'll get you the advice and expertise you need, access to angel investors and VCs, all while helping you recruit talent and make important business connections. You'll work through important challenges and experience some of the biggest and most profitable growth your company will have seen to this point. At the end of your tenure at Start Tank, Demo Day brings startups and investors together for the next big step. 
<br /><br />
We've already invested heavily in helping startups succeed. We are only able to do that because not long ago, PayPal was once a startup too. Our offices are full of entrepreneurs who are committed to helping other entrepreneurs.

	<h2>Our Program</h2>
	<p>
Start Tank provides six months of no-cost professional space, infrastructure, coaching and community to early-stage startups (pre-series A funding). Our ideal candidate is looking for between two to five desks and an environment that encourages collaboration and innovation. Candidates may not compete with PayPal. 
<br /><br />
Start Tank startups can access PayPal facilities for events. In addition, resident companies are able to leverage a closed beta testing group of PayPal employees in that office. Each startup has a designated employee sponsor that stays with them during their tenure. This “Pal” helps them navigate PayPal to make sure that they get the expert advice and connections they need.
